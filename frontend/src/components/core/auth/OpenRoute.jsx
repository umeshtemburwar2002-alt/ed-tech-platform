 * OpenRoute — wraps public pages (Login, Signup, ForgotPassword).
 *
 * If a user IS authenticated, redirect them to the correct dashboard.
 *
 * Must wait for authInitialized before redirecting — otherwise a user who
 * lands on /login right after a page refresh would see a flash redirect
 * BEFORE onAuthStateChange fires (token is still null at that point).
 * Without the guard, token=null → show login form. Then 50ms later
 * onAuthStateChange fires → token set → OpenRoute redirects. That
 * 50ms "flash" of the login form is fine. The critical thing is we
 * never redirect prematurely.
